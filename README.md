Demo can be found [here](https://www.resistancemappingproject.com "Title").

To deploy, open google-doc-url.js, view the links and create your own google sheets in the same format (you can copy/paste directly into google sheets), publish the sheets from the google sheets editor (file > publish), then replace the links in your google-doc-url.js file.
